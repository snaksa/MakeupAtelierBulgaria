                Bubbling over with creativity, Dany Sanz got an early start in the art world and the night world, populated with colourful characters. For this former fine arts student, her calling became clear when some friends asked her to do the makeup for a show. With her committed and generous attitude, and perfect mastery of shapes and interplays of shadow and light, she put all of her energy into the first body paintings. She was one of the creators of this movement, which she considers to be a means of artistic expression in itself.
                Backstage, she stole the spotlight with her makeup creations that caught the eye of professionals worldwide. The media began to focus on this artist with such an electric temperament.
                A professor at heart, she created the first professional makeup school in Europe in the 70s. It met with great success due to the quality of the teaching, the excellence of the makeup techniques that she taught and the special relationship that she nurtured with her students.
                Avant-garde, creative and a pioneer of makeup, Dany Sanz decided to formulate textures to compensate for the limited professional product offer at the time. Dany Sanz’s life would be makeup… forever.
                A COMPANY CREATED BY AN ARTIST IN 1984
                When she realised that her formulas were increasingly appreciated, Dany Sanz felt that the moment had come to create her own brand. Her renowned product expertise and her intuition for development were her best allies.
